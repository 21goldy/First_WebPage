            Chess originated in India during the Gupta Empire. 
            There, its early form in the 6th century was known as chaturaṅga, which translates
            as "four divisions(of the military)": infantry, cavalry, elephantry, and chariotry. 
            These forms are represented by the pieces that would evolve into
            the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively.
        <br/>
        In the second half of the 19th century, modern chess tournament play began, and 
        the first World Chess Championship was held in 1886.
        The 20th century saw great leaps forward in chess theory and the establishment
        of the World Chess Federation (FIDE).
        In 1997, a computer first beat a chess world champion in the famous Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov match,
        ushering in an era of computer domination. Since then, computer analysis – which originated in the 1970s with 
        the first programmed chess games on the market – has contributed to much of the development in chess theory and
        has become an important part of preparation in professional human chess. Later developments in the 21st century made
        the use of computer analysis far surpassing the ability of any human player accessible to the public.
        Online gaming, which first appeared in the mid-1990s, also became popular in the 21st century.
        <br/>
        Chess remains a highly popular pastime to this day. A 2012 survey found that
        "chess players now make up one of the largest communities in the world: 605 million adults play chess regularly". 
        Chess is played at least once a year by 12% of British people, 15% of Americans, 23% of Germans, 43% of Russians, and 
        70% of Indian people.

    The earliest precursor of modern chess is a game called chaturanga, which flourished in India by the 6th century, 
    
    and is the earliest known game to have two essential features found in all later chess variations—different pieces 
    
    having different powers (which was not the case with checkers and Go), and victory depending on the fate of one piece,
    
    the king of modern chess.<br/>

 
    A common theory is that India's development of the board, and chess, was likely due to India's mathematical enlightenment
    
    involving the creation of the number zero. Other game pieces (speculatively called "chess pieces") uncovered in archaeological 
    
    findings are considered as coming from other, distantly related board games, which may have had boards of 100 squares or more.

    Chess was designed for an ashtāpada (Sanskrit for "having eight feet", i.e. an 8×8 squared board), which may have been used earlier 
    
    for a backgammon-type race game (perhaps related to a dice-driven race game still played in south India where the track starts at
    
    the middle of a side and spirals into the center). Ashtāpada, the uncheckered 8×8 board served as the main board for playing chaturanga. 

    Other Indian boards included the 10×10 Dasapada and the 9×9 Saturankam. Traditional Indian chessboards often have X markings on some or 
    
    all of squares a1 a4 a5 a8 d1 d4 d5 d8 e1 e4 e5 e8 h1 h4 h5 h8: these may have been "safe squares" where capturing was not allowed in a 
    
    dice-driven backgammon-type race game played on the ashtāpada before chess was invented.
    
    The Cox-Forbes theory, proposed in the late 18th century by Hiram Cox, and later developed by Duncan Forbes, asserted that the four-handed 
    
    game chaturaji was the original form of chaturanga. The theory is no longer considered tenable.<br/>
    
    In Sanskrit, "chaturanga" (चतुरङ्ग) literally means "having four limbs (or parts)" and in epic poetry often means "army" 
    
    (the four parts are elephants, chariots, horsemen, foot soldiers). The name came from a battle formation mentioned in the Indian epic Mahabharata.
    
    The game chaturanga was a battle-simulation game which rendered Indian military strategy of the time.
    
    Some people formerly played chess using a die to decide which piece to move. There was an unproven theory that chess started as this dice-chess and 
    
    that the gambling and dice aspects of the game were removed because of Hindu religious objections.
    
    Scholars in areas to which the game subsequently spread, for example the Arab Abu al-Hasan 'Alī al-Mas'ūdī, detailed the Indian use of chess as a tool
    
    for military strategy, mathematics, gambling and even its vague association with astronomy. Mas'ūdī notes that ivory in India was chiefly used for the 
    
    production of chess and backgammon pieces, 

    and asserts that the game was introduced to Persia from India, along with the book Kelileh va Demneh, during the reign of emperor Nushirwan.<br/>
    
    In some variants, a win was by checkmate, or by stalemate, or by "bare king" (taking all of an opponent's pieces except the king).
    
    In some parts of India the pieces in the places of the rook, knight and bishop were renamed by words meaning (in this order) Boat, Horse, and Elephant, 
    
    or Elephant, Horse, and Camel, but keeping the same moves.
